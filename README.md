## Week 4
This week we began our puzzle box project. I'm working with Ece and Doruk. We wanted to implement a game into our box. So we began by brainstorming some ideas and decided on Doruk's idea of a flip switching game. 

Concept
Our puzzle box would open once the player lights up all the LEDs. The player interacts with the box by pressing buttons which correspond to a LED position.

We needed to see how the puzzle would play and whether it was fun.

After playing the prototype we found that the puzzle was really simple once you worked it out. Perhaps making the grid a 4x4 or 5x5 grid. However we wouldn't have enough pins on our Arduinos

- too easy, maybe it would be more fun as 4x4? or 5x5.
  - we dont have the space on our arduino to do that
  - lets add a constraint instead
    - the puzzle will reset after x seconds
