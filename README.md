hi, this blog still mostly exists in the form of screenshots, videos and notes on my ipad. I will be presenting my journal here but for the moment it probably looks empty

## Week 4
This week we began our puzzle box project. I'm working with Ece and Doruk. 


Prototype Game 
https://absolutekaoss.itch.io/puzzlebox-prototype-game?secret=OVinQhlO6sBgXtHpsEtwD7moAY
- we needed to see how the puzzle would play
- to check whether it was fun or not
- too easy, maybe it would be more fun as 4x4? or 5x5.
  - we dont have the space on our arduino to do that
  - lets add a constraint instead
    - the puzzle will reset after x seconds

Concept
- a box that would open when the user completes the puzzle
- 

## Week 3
Project 7 - Keyboard
- I had problems getting one button to work.
  - turns out the board was scratched, i changed the button to a different row
