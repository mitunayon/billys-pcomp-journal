## Week 4
This week we began our puzzle box project. I'm working with Ece and Doruk. We wanted to implement a game into our box. So we began by brainstorming some ideas and decided on Doruk's idea of a flip switching game. 

Our puzzle box would open once the player lights up all the LEDs. To get to this state, the player flips an LED on/off by pressing its corresponding button. However, when the player presses that button it will also flip the LEDs in the same row and column. This gives the box an element of a puzzle

We needed to see how the puzzle would play and whether it was fun.

After playing the prototype we learnt that the puzzle was really simple once you worked it out. Perhaps making the grid a 4x4 or 5x5 would make the game more interesting. However we wouldn't have enough pins on our Arduinos. So we thought about having a time constraint that would reset the puzzle after an amount of time.
